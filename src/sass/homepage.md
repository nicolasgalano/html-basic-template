# Styleguide


## Why styleguides?
Styleguides can be seen as a roadmap for developers and designers to maintain consistency on their code and UI. Some styleguides are built in static HTML, but this is difficult to maintain. A better solution would be a living styleguide, which is auto-generated from the comments in your codebase.

During the project lifetime, different developers encounter the codebase. Without an overview of the current foundation of the project, the code could get messy very quickly. With a styleguide you will have consistency, which is easier to maintain. Consistent code keeps the codebase structured and small, this gives the performance a boost. You will have faster build times, because you can refer to the styleguide for the exact styles to use. Besides the usefulness for designers and developers, it could also be helpful for project managers and third parties. You create a common language.

**To get familiar with the documentation syntax it is highly advised to read through [the annotated copy of the official KSS spec on the KSS-node repository](https://github.com/kss-node/kss/blob/spec/SPEC.md).*
